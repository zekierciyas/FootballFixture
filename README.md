# FootballFixture Application

## Description of app
```
The application mainly draws and lists the fake data I have created on "mockapi" with the help of retrofit the matches in three time zones. In the first version, nestedScrollView is used. Then I passed it to the recyclerView in support of children parents. The architecture used in the project is MVVM architecture.
